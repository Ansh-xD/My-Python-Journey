# OPERATORS IN PYTHON
# Following are some common operators in python:


# 1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / etc.
print("this is a Arithmetic operators example ")
a = 55
b = 5
c = a + b
print(c)



# 2. Assignment operators: =, +=, -= etc.
print("this is a Assigment operators example ")
a = 6 - 4 # Assian 4-6 is a 2
print(a)
b = 11
b += 4 # b = 11 , b += 4 means b = 11 + 4   [{means total ke bad koi value add karna (+=)}]
print(b)
print(a + b)



# 3. Comparison operators: ==, >, >=, <, != etc.
print("this is a comparion operators example ") # comparion alway answer in true/flase (boolean variables)
a = 5<6
print(a)   # != means not equal to




# 4. Logical operators: and, or, not.\
print("this is a Logical operators example ")
e = True or False
print(e)


print("This is truth table of 'Or' in python")


print("True or Flase is" , True or False)
print("False or True is" , False or True)
print("True or True is " , True or True)
print("False or False is" , False or False)

print("This is truth table of 'and' in python")


print("True and Flase is" , True and False)
print("False and True is" , False and True)
print("True and True is " , True and True)
print("False and False is" , False and False)


#print("this is a not operators example ")
print("this is a Not operators example ")
 
print(not(True))
print(not(False))
